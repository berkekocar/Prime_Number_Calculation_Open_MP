METHODOLOGY

 * Task1 - OPENMP
 * In this task I calculated the total prime number frequencies between 1 to 10000000.
 * I have used the prime number calculation algorithm from the notes.
 * My development environment was MacOSX that I have installed OpenMP natively on my terminal.
 * For compiling and executing the program I used following commands:
 * Compiling: clang -Xpreprocessor -fopenmp openmp.c -lomp
